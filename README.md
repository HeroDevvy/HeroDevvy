# Heyo! I'm HeroDev,
### I'm a newbie in Python programming that wants to learn more about AI and Machine Learning!
  
  
  - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a windows program that lets you customize deeper some OS stuff like translucent tb, rainmeter, etc
  - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python!
  - ðŸ“– I've also studied photography and film making, so i've got a slight grasp of Photoshop, Premiere Pro and After Effects as well!
