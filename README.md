# Heyo! I'm HeroDev,
### I'm a newbie in Python programming that wants to learn more about AI and Machine Learning!
  
  
  - 🔭 I’m currently working on a windows program that lets you customize deeper some OS stuff like translucent tb, rainmeter, etc
  - 🌱 I’m currently learning Python!
  - 📖 I've also studied photography and film making, so i've got a slight grasp of Photoshop, Premiere Pro and After Effects as well!
